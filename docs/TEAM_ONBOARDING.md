# LightSpeed WP Changelog Automation — Team Onboarding Guide

**Phase 1 Complete** | Ready for Team Implementation  
**Document Version:** 1.0 | Updated: 2026-10-30

---

## Welcome, Team! 👋

This guide teaches you how to use, test, extend, and contribute to the LightSpeed WP changelog automation system. Whether you're building WordPress block themes or plugins, this toolkit enforces consistent, production-ready changelogs across your project.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Git (for working with our branch-based workflow)
- A text editor

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the changelog repository
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/changelog ~/Studio/changelog
cd ~/Studio/changelog

# Install dependencies for both sub-skills
cd sub-skills/branch-context-mapper
npm install

cd ../changelog-validator
npm install

# Return to root
cd ../..
```

### Step 2: Install Git Hooks

```bash
# Install lefthook for pre-commit validation
lefthook install

# Verify hooks are active
lefthook run pre-commit --all-files
```

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
# Test branch-context-mapper
cd sub-skills/branch-context-mapper
npm test

# Test changelog-validator
cd ../changelog-validator
npm test
```

**✅ Success:** Both test suites pass with 90%+ coverage. You're ready to develop!

## 📚 Understanding the Two Sub-Skills

### 1. **branch-context-mapper**
**Purpose:** Analyze a git branch name and extract changelog metadata.

**What it does:**
- Extracts branch type (feature, fix, security, etc.)
- Maps type → changelog category (Added, Fixed, Security, etc.)
- Calculates semantic version bump (MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)
- Detects breaking changes

**Quick example:**
```bash
cd sub-skills/branch-context-mapper
node scripts/branch-context-mapper.cjs feature/oauth-authentication
```

Output:
```json
{
  "branchType": "feature",
  "category": "Added",
  "versionBump": "MINOR",
  "isBreaking": false
}
```

**Branch types (LightSpeed WP convention):**
- `feature/` → "Added" (MINOR bump)
- `fix/` → "Fixed" (PATCH bump)
- `security/` → "Security" (PATCH bump, breaking-change aware)
- `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `chore/` → No changelog entry
- `breaking:` prefix → Sets isBreaking to true (MAJOR bump)

---

### 2. **changelog-validator**
**Purpose:** Run a basic changelog format check. Governance and quality review are manual.

**What it does:**
- Checks that the file contains a `# Changelog` title and at least one version heading (`## [x.y.z]` or `## [Unreleased]`)
- Returns a fixed placeholder score (85 on a pass, 0 on a fail), placeholder governance strings and a `readyForRelease` flag that only mirrors the basic check
- Does **not** validate version numbers, dates, entry content or the six governance principles; review those manually

**Quick example:**
```bash
cd sub-skills/changelog-validator
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs ../../CHANGELOG.md --json
```

Output (placeholder values; the governance fields are not real checks):
```json
{
  "isValid": true,
  "score": 85,
  "errors": [],
  "governance": {
    "immutability": "pass",
    "atomicity": "pass",
    "consistency": "pass",
    "completeness": "pass",
    "clarity": "pass",
    "traceability": "pass"
  },
  "readyForRelease": true
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

### Running Jest (Unit Tests)

```bash
# Run all tests in a sub-skill
cd sub-skills/branch-context-mapper
npm test

# Run in watch mode (auto-rerun on save)
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:jest -- --coverage
```

**Coverage requirements:** 90% across lines, functions, branches, and statements.

### Running BATS (Integration Tests)

```bash
# Run all BATS tests
cd sub-skills/branch-context-mapper
npm run test:bats

# Run a specific test file
bats tests/branch-context-mapper.bats

# Run with verbose output
bats --verbose-run tests/branch-context-mapper.bats
```

**Expect:** 100% pass rate on all BATS tests.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Lefthook runs automatically before each commit:
1. **Branch naming validation** — Checks your branch name matches LightSpeed conventions
2. **Jest coverage check** — Ensures 90%+ coverage before allowing commit
3. **BATS test pass** — Verifies all shell integration tests pass
4. **Commit message format** — Validates message against branch-based rules

To bypass (⚠️ use with caution):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

---

## 🛠️ Extending the Skills

### Adding a New Branch Type

**For branch-context-mapper:**

1. **Update the mapping** in `sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/scripts/branch-context-mapper.cjs`:

```javascript
const BRANCH_TYPES = {
  'feature': { category: 'Added', versionBump: 'MINOR' },
  'fix': { category: 'Fixed', versionBump: 'PATCH' },
  'experimental': { category: 'Experimental', versionBump: 'MINOR' },  // NEW
};
```

2. **Add a test** in `__tests__/branch-context-mapper.test.js`:

```javascript
describe('experimental branch type', () => {
  it('should map experimental to Experimental category', () => {
    const result = mapBranchType('experimental/new-feature');
    expect(result.category).toBe('Experimental');
  });
});
```

3. **Add integration test** in `tests/branch-context-mapper.bats`:

```bash
@test "experimental branch maps to Experimental" {
  result=$(node scripts/branch-context-mapper.cjs experimental/test)
  [[ "$result" =~ "Experimental" ]]
}
```

4. **Update documentation** in `sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/references/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`.

5. **Run tests** to verify:
```bash
npm test
```

### Adding a New Governance Rule

**For changelog-validator:**

1. **Implement the rule** in `scripts/validate-changelog.cjs`:

```javascript
function checkDeprecationNotice(changelogContent) {
  // Your rule implementation
  return {
    passed: /* boolean */,
    details: /* description */
  };
}
```

2. **Add unit test** in `__tests__/validate-changelog.test.js`:

```javascript
describe('deprecation-notice rule', () => {
  it('should pass when deprecation entries have notices', () => {
    const result = validateGovernanceRule('deprecation-notice', content);
    expect(result.passed).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

3. **Add integration test** in `tests/validate-changelog.bats`:

```bash
@test "deprecation entries must include notices" {
  # Hypothetical example: the current validators have no --rule option
  run validate-changelog --rule deprecation-notice
  [[ "$status" -eq 0 ]]
}
```

4. **Document the rule** in `sub-skills/changelog-validator/references/GOVERNANCE_RULES.md`.

---

## 📖 Governance Rules (Quick Reference)

All changelog entries should follow these 6 principles. They are manual review guidance; the helpers do not enforce them:

1. **Immutability** — Released versions never change (only [Unreleased] is mutable)
2. **Atomicity** — Each entry references exactly one PR or issue
3. **Consistency** — All entries follow Keep a Changelog format
4. **Completeness** — [Unreleased] section is empty before release
5. **Clarity** — Entries are clear and meet your team's quality bar (reviewed manually)
6. **Traceability** — Every entry links to code (PR/issue/commit)

**Quality review (manual):** The helper score is a fixed placeholder, not a quality measure. Review entries by hand: production-ready entries are clear, linked and correctly categorised; otherwise request changes.

## 🎨 WordPress Block Theme/Plugin Examples

### Example 1: Adding a Changelog Entry for a Block Theme Feature

**Branch:** `feature/hero-block-animation`

```bash
# This is what the mapper extracts:
# branchType: "feature"
# category: "Added"
# versionBump: "MINOR"
```

**Changelog entry:**
```markdown
## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-15

### Added
- Hero block with configurable animations and parallax support ([#42](https://github.com/lightspeedwp/my-theme/pull/42))
```

### Example 2: Security Fix for a WooCommerce Plugin

**Branch:** `security/checkout-xss-fix`

```bash
# Mapper extracts:
# branchType: "security"
# category: "Security"
# versionBump: "PATCH"
# isBreaking: true (if sensitive API removed)
```

**Changelog entry:**
```markdown
## [1.2.1] - 2026-11-14

### Security
- Fixed XSS vulnerability in checkout form input sanitization ([#89](https://github.com/lightspeedwp/my-plugin/pull/89))
```

### Example 3: Breaking Change in a Block Plugin

**Branch:** `breaking:block-api-v2-migration`

```bash
# Mapper extracts:
# branchType: "breaking"
# category: "Changed" (or "Added" + breaking flag)
# versionBump: "MAJOR"
# isBreaking: true
```

**Changelog entry:**
```markdown
## [2.0.0] - 2026-11-13

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Block registration API changed from `registerBlockType()` to `registerBlock()`. Update all blocks. ([#156](https://github.com/lightspeedwp/my-blocks/pull/156))

### Added
- New registration API with better TypeScript support
```

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create a Feature Branch and Add Changelog Entry

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (mapper validates naming)
git checkout -b feature/add-block-alignment-controls

# 2. Make your changes
# ... edit code ...

# 3. Write changelog entry (review quality manually; the helper checks only the basic format)
# Edit CHANGELOG.md with new entry

# 4. Commit (lefthook runs pre-commit checks)
git commit -m "feat(blocks): add alignment controls to gallery block

- Adds left, center, right, justify alignment options
- Updates block.json with new attributes
- Adds e2e tests for alignment UX

Fixes #42"

# 5. Push (pre-push hook runs final validation)
git push origin feature/add-block-alignment-controls

# 6. Create PR (review the changelog entry manually)
# Illustrative workflow: this repository has no CI workflow yet
```

### Workflow 2: Review and Approve a PR

```bash
# 1. Reviewer checks branch name
# ✅ "feature/user-auth-flow" — good

# 2. Reviewer checks changelog entry
# Run validator locally:
cd sub-skills/changelog-validator
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs ../../CHANGELOG.md --json
# The helper only checks the basic format (placeholder score); assess entry quality manually

# 3. Request changes:
# "Excellent work! Please add a link to the related issue for full traceability."

# 4. Author updates and re-commits
# Re-review the updated entry manually

# 5. Approve and merge
# Illustrative: a release CI check is a target, not something this repository provides yet
```

### Workflow 3: Cut a Release

```bash
# 1. Verify changelog is release-ready
cd sub-skills/changelog-validator
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs CHANGELOG.md
# Basic format check passes (placeholder score 85); review release readiness manually

# 2. Create release branch
git checkout -b release/1.2.0

# 3. Update version numbers (handled by CI)

# 4. Finalize changelog
# Move [Unreleased] section to new version heading
# Update dates and version numbers

# 5. Commit and push
git commit -m "chore(release): 1.2.0"
git push origin release/1.2.0

# 6. Create release PR
# CI validates everything

# 7. Merge and tag
# GitHub Actions cuts the release automatically
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Pre-commit hook failed: Branch name does not match LightSpeed conventions"

**Cause:** Your branch name is invalid.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check branch naming rules
cat sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/references/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md

# Rename your branch
git branch -m feature/my-bad-name feature/my-good-name
```

### "Jest coverage threshold not met: 87% < 90%"

**Cause:** Your tests don't cover enough code.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Open the HTML report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Add tests to uncovered lines
# Re-run: npm test
```

### "Changelog validation failed"

**Cause:** The changelog is missing its `# Changelog` title or has no version heading.

**Run the validator to see what failed:**
```bash
cd sub-skills/changelog-validator
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs ../../CHANGELOG.md --json
```

This nested helper only checks for the title and a version-heading pattern, so it does not catch an invalid version number or date (for example `## [1.2.3] - not-a-date` passes). Review versions, dates and entry quality (missing issue/PR links, length, unclear language) manually. The separate root validator (`node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs CHANGELOG.md` from the repository root, used by the pre-commit hook) checks the title and the release structure more strictly.

**Fix:** Update your entry with:
- Clear, action-oriented description
- Link to PR or issue
- Context for other developers
