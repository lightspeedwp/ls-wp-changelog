# Prompt: Create a Release Version

Convert your `[Unreleased]` section to a versioned release with a date and semantic version bump. Here the new version is worked out from the current version and the release type. (To convert with a version you are given, see [create-release.md](create-release.md).)

## Scope

This prompt describes a manual edit of `CHANGELOG.md`. It does not commit, tag, push or publish anything; those are separate release actions that need explicit authorisation. Derive the proposed new version from the current version and the release type (for example 1.0.0 with Minor gives 1.1.0), and use the release date you are given; do not invent the date or a different version. The `(#1089)` style in the examples follows [Changelog Format](../docs/CHANGELOG_FORMAT.md); the [link verifier](../sub-skills/changelog-link-verifier/SKILL.md) is stricter and expects an adjacent PR link and issue link on each entry.

## Input

**Current version:** 1.0.0  
**Release type:** Minor (new feature)  
**Release date:** 2026-10-30  
**Current CHANGELOG.md:**

```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for async/await in skill execution (#1089)
- New `concurrency` configuration option (#1089)

### Fixed
- Memory leak in startup (#1092)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Initial release
```

## Expected Output

The `[Unreleased]` section becomes `[1.1.0] - 2026-10-30`, and a new empty `[Unreleased]` is created:

```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- Support for async/await in skill execution (#1089)
- New `concurrency` configuration option (#1089)

### Fixed
- Memory leak in startup (#1092)

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- Initial release
```

## Key Points

- Version bumps: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 (minor), 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 (major), 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 (patch)
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
- Create new `[Unreleased]` for future entries
- Add horizontal rule (`---`) before previous versions for readability
- Keep versions in descending order
- The bump is a judgement from the actual changes; the branch mapper's version hint is advisory only

## Verify

From this repository's root, run the root validator on the result (it checks the title, version and date formats, and that `[Unreleased]` has no date):

```bash
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs CHANGELOG.md
```

For a target project, use the sub-skill helper (it only checks for a title and a version heading):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/sub-skills/changelog-validator/scripts/validate-changelog.cjs" "/absolute/path/to/CHANGELOG.md" --json
```

Entry quality, version order and the choice of bump remain manual checks.
